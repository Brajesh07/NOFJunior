The idea stayed with him and he focused on acquiring the required skills of being an exceptionally talented business person. He worked at a job for a few years and learned the required skills with the help of his colleagues.
                  Finally in March 2012, with the help of his wife, Arti Tiwari and ex-colleague, Kunal Bhusare, they faced it all whatever came their way and established “Gyrix Technolabs”.</p>
